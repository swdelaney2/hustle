              <p>Because of social distancing guidelines related to COVID-19, this year's Hustle Up the Hill for the Homeless will be a virtual race.</p>

              <p>Cost is $30 per person or $25 each for groups of 4. Those who register by Aug. 1 will receive a T-shirt.</p>

              <p>Registered participants can complete the event anytime between <strong>Aug. 22-31, 2020</strong>. Participants have the option of going up and down Mt. Hoy at Blackwell Forest Preserve in Warrenville or completing a 5K run or walk on the route of their choice or on a treadmill. Participants are encouraged to send in their race results and photos.</p>

              <p>All proceeds from the event will go to house a homeless family for 2 years as they transition to self-sufficiency. Please help us end homelessness during this difficult time of the pandemic.</p>
