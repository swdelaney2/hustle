                <p><strong>9th Annual Hustle Up The Hill & Flat 1K Walk For The Homeless</strong>
                <br>Mt. Hoy, Blackwell Forest Preserve
                <br>Warrenville, IL
                <br>September 23, 2023
                <br>Heats 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM
                <br>Or participate virtually - complete the race anytime between September 24th & 30th

                <p>Challenge yourself to run/walk up Mt. Hoy or, new this year, complete the flat 1K walk for this cause.

                <p>All proceeds from the event will go to house a homeless family for 2 years as they transition to self-sufficiency in partnership with the Bridge Communities program.

                <p>Cost is $30 per person or $25 per person with a team of four or more. Race day registration is $35.

              <p>Beautiful Mt. Hoy, which rises 836 feet above sea level, gives you an awesome panoramic view of the western suburbs and if the skies are clear, you can see the Chicago skyline in the distance.

              <p>Each round trip up and down Mt. Hoy is approximately .3 miles, but involves a variable incline. Walk or run to see how many times you can make it up and down the hill in 30 minutes.

              <p>Run solo or form a team. Run with the family. Do your thing. T-shirts and gourmet coffee await you at the finish line.
