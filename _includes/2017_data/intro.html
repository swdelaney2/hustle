              <p>Beautiful Mt. Hoy, which rises 836 feet above sea level, gives you an awesome panoramic view of the western suburbs and if the skies are clear, you can see the Chicago skyline in the distance. But first, you have get to the top. Lace up your running (or walking) shoes and join us on <strong>June 6, 2021</strong> as we have fun while raising funds for Bridge Communities.

              <p>Run solo or form a team. Run with the family. Do your thing. T-shirts and gourmet coffee await you at the finish line.

              <p>Registration will open closer to the event and the link will be posted here.

              <p>All proceeds from the event will go to house a homeless family for 2 years as they transition to self-sufficiency. If you're not racing this year, but still want to help, please consider making a <a href="https://st-irene.churchgiving.com/ws/opportunities/BridgeCommunities" target="_top">donation</a> directly to Bridge Communities.
