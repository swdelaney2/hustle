              <p>We were well on our way to prepare for this year’s race in May, but decided we needed to postpone in light of the virus spreading throughout the country this March. If you already signed up, you are all set for the new date. Stay safe and see everyone in the Fall.</p>

              <p>Are you ready to conquer the mountain? How many times can you hustle up Blackwell’s Mt Hoy?

              <p>Beautiful Mt. Hoy, which rises 836 feet above sea level, gives you an awesome panoramic view of the western suburbs and if the skies are clear, you can see the Chicago skyline in the distance. But first, you have get to the top. Lace up your running (or walking) shoes and join us on <strong>September 27, 2020</strong> as we have fun while raising funds for Bridge Communities.

              <p>Run solo or form a team. Run with the family. Do your thing. T-shirts and gourmet coffee await you at the finish line.
