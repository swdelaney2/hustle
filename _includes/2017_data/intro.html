              <p>Are you ready to conquer the mountain? How many times can you hustle up Blackwellâ€™s Mt Hoy?

              <p>Beautiful Mt. Hoy, which rises 836 feet above sea level, gives you an awesome panoramic view of the western suburbs and if the skies are clear, you can see the Chicago skyline in the distance. But first, you have get to the top. Lace up your running (or walking) shoes and join us on <strong>September 11, 2022 at Blackwell Forest Preserve in Warrenville, Illinois</strong> as we have fun while raising funds for Bridge Communities. You can also participate virtually, just complete the race anytime between September 11 - 18!

              <p>Each round trip up and down Mt. Hoy is approximately .3 miles, but involves a variable incline. Walk or run to see how many times you can make it up and down the hill in 30 minutes.

              <p>Run solo or form a team. Run with the family. Do your thing. T-shirts and gourmet coffee await you at the finish line.

              <p>Registration will open closer to the event and the link will be posted here.

              <p>All proceeds from the event will go to house a homeless family for 2 years as they transition to self-sufficiency. If you're not racing this year, but still want to help, please consider making a <a href="https://st-irene.churchgiving.com/ws/opportunities/BridgeCommunities" target="_top">donation</a> directly to Bridge Communities.
