      <p>Bridge Communities is a grassroots, 501c3 charitable organization, serving homeless families in DuPage County.  Its mission is to transition homeless families to self-sufficiency by working with partners to provide mentoring, housing, and supportive services.

      <p>Celebrating its 28th anniversary this year, Bridge is the largest provider of transitional supportive housing in the county, with multi-unit apartment buildings located in eight communities, including Addison, Carol Stream, Glendale Heights, Glen Ellyn, Lombard, Naperville, Westmont, and Woodridge.  To qualify for the program, applicants must:

      <ul>
        <li>Have a connection to DuPage County, by either living or working here</li>
        <li>Be homeless or at immediate risk of homelessness</li>
        <li>Be an adult with a children or children under age 18</li>
        <li>Be employable.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Bridge is a non-faith based organization, and does not discriminate on the basis of religion in the application process for clients, staff, or volunteers.  However, Bridge has long-standing and strong relationships with over 40 churches in the County, who provide a third of its funding stream as well as volunteer mentors who work directly with clients in a two year program.  Bridge also partners with several non faith-based community organizations, who together serve almost 25% of client families.  The churches and community organizations are collectively known as “Program Partners”.

      <p>Since its founding, Bridge has served over 600 homeless families, providing them an opportunity to transition from the crises of homelessness to stable housing and self-sufficiency.  To meet the demands of rising poverty and homelessness in the County, Bridge is in the final stages of a $5 million capital campaign to increase its capacity from 100 to 135 families at any one time.  This will also require as many as twenty more organizations, including churches and community groups, to step forward as Program Partners.  Bridge encourages members of the communities it serves to support financially both the Program Partners and Bridge in achieving its goals.  The next 600 families can be touched in just the next TEN years.
